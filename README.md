# Expense tracker

This is a simple expense tracker portfolio application, created with ReactJS. A showcase of my React knowledge with 'Hooks', 'Dynamic rendering', 'Component structure' and so on.

## features

- dynamically opened / closed 'add new expense' feature
- dynamically filtered expenses
- dynamic monthly 'amount' chart

Dummy data provided, but you can easily add your own expenses to the list with the 'add expense' feature
